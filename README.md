# TWEETS_EMOTION_DETECTION

This project involves sentiment analysis of tweets using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, and classification using logistic regression. The model is trained and evaluated on a tweet dataset, and the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are computed. Finally, the trained model is used to predict the sentiment of new tweets.
